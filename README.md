Loom is a simple moodboard web app that lets you collect, organize, and export images for inspiration. Add images by URL or from your device, remove them with a click, and export your entire moodboard as a PNG.

## Features
- Add images instantly by pasting direct image URLs
- Upload images directly from your device
- Smart URL validation to prevent broken images
- Remove individual images via a subtle **x** action
- Clear the entire moodboard in one click
- Export the full board as a PNG
- Share your moodboard via supported apps

---

## Design Inspiration
The layout and styling are heavily inspired by **Google’s Material Design language**, focusing on:
- Clean, minimal surfaces
- Rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Responsive grid layout
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

---

## Why Loom?
Loom was built as a lightweight, distraction-free way to capture visual ideas quickly.  
No accounts, no clutter, just collect, arrange, and export inspiration when you need it.

---

## Notes
- Images must be publicly accessible if added via URL
- Images are stored temporarily in the session
- Drag-and-drop reordering is intentionally excluded for now to preserve layout simplicity

---

## Final Thoughts
Loom is small by design. Fast to use, easy to understand, and focused on visuals first.

Open Loom, start weaving, and let your ideas stack up.
