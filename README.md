Loom is a simple moodboard web app that lets you collect, organize, and export images for inspiration. Add images by URL or from your device, remove them with a click, and export your entire moodboard as a PNG.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration
The layout and styling are heavily inspired by **Google’s Material Design language**, focusing on:
- Clean, minimal surfaces
- Rounded corners and smooth effects
- Responsive grid layout

## 🧠 Why Loom?
Loom was built as a lightweight, distraction-free way to capture visual ideas quickly.  
No accounts, no clutter — just collect, arrange, and export inspiration when you need it.

## 📌 Notes
- Images must be publicly accessible if added via URL
- Images are stored temporarily in the session
- Drag-and-drop reordering is intentionally excluded for now to preserve layout simplicity

## 🧵 Final Thoughts
Loom is small by design. Fast to use, easy to understand, and focused on visuals first.

Open Loom, start weaving, and let your ideas stack up.
