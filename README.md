![Material Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/Inspired%20by-Material%20Design-blue?logo=google)

Loom is a simple moodboard web app that lets you collect, organize, and export images for inspiration. Add images by URL, remove them with a click, and export your entire moodboard as a PNG.

## 🌐 Live Demo
👉 [Visit Loom on GitHub Pages](https://paulspective.github.io/loom/)

## ✨ Features
- Add images instantly by pasting direct image URLs
- Smart URL validation to prevent broken images
- Remove individual images via a subtle **X** action
- Clear the entire moodboard in one click
- Export the full board as a high-resolution PNG using `html2canvas`
- Automatic persistence with `localStorage` so your board survives refreshes

---

## 🎨 Design Inspiration
The layout and styling are heavily inspired by **Google’s Material Design language**, focusing on:
- Clean, minimal surfaces
- Rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Responsive grid layout
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser, or serve with a local web server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulspective/loom.git
cd loom
```

## 🧠 Why Loom?
Loom was built as a lightweight, distraction-free way to capture visual ideas quickly.  
No accounts, no clutter — just collect, arrange, and export inspiration when you need it.

---

## 📌 Notes
- Images must be publicly accessible and allow cross-origin loading
- Drag-and-drop reordering is intentionally excluded for now to preserve layout simplicity

---

## 🧵 Final Thoughts
Loom is a small tool by design. Fast to use, easy to understand, and focused on visuals first.

Open `index.html`, start weaving, and let the ideas stack up.
